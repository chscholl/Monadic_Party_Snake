# Monadic Party Snake

This repository contains the skeleton code for making a snake game as shown at [Monadic Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yYchqXbMhA).

## How to get started

```
cd Monadic_Party_Snake
stack setup
stack build
stack exec snake
```

This will give you the following errors:

```
snake: Prelude.undefined
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at libraries/base/GHC/Err.hs:78:14 in base:GHC.Err
  undefined, called at src/Main.hs:264:19 in main:Main
```

Happy codeing !
